Work / Project Examples

    In this project I was in charge of displaying the movie details when a user clicks on the movie they want from the second page after searching. I was also in charge of the favorites button so that when a user favorites a movie they can go back to the home page and view those specific movies they have favorited. I had also helped to make the filter buttons function but majority of that work was done by my partner.
    
2.  The files for the project are uploaded. This project was built in andriod studio and so I can't upload a link to it. The project was an app that can take a picture of an object and the user can later on edit it to change the colour of it. My role was to set up the storage of the image when the user decides to save it so they can edit it later on or view it later. I accomplished this by using firebase and storing the image in the users account.
