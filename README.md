Work / Project Examples

    In this project I was in charge of displaying the movie details when a user clicks on the movie they want from the second page after searching. I was also in charge     of the favorites button so that when a user favorites a movie they can go back to the home page and view those specific movies they have favorited. I had also helped     to make the filter buttons function but majority of that work was done by my partner.
    
2.  The files for the project are uploaded. This project was built in andriod studio and so I can't upload a link to it. The project was an app that can take a picture       of an object and the user can later on edit it to change the colour of it. My role was to set up the storage of the image when the user decides to save it so they       can edit it later on or view it later. I accomplished this by using firebase and storing the image in the users account.

Inspiration

   I found this game on sandbox when a friend showed it to me and it's one game that I've always thought about when the subject of game development comes along because      the game looks and feels very professional and something that I'd expect to be on steam for people to buy. The thing that I find in spiring about this is the special    effects of the game since the most I've ever done are slow transitions when clicking on a button of a form. Making something that has smooth transitions has always      been something I've been intruged in. Seeing that it can all be done with javascript is also interesting since most games are developed on some type of engine.

   Apples design on their webpages has always interested me and left me thinking how I can do this. Their scrolling animations has always been one of the best and I have    yet to see something better. I have made a couple websites for my classes and if I were given more time to focus on the visual I would try and make it similar to        apples scrolling animations.

   The BMW Insight App from Critical Mass has been in the back of my head ever since I found out about it. I realize that there are many AR apps out there but the tidiness and overall look of the app was very impressive. The major aspect that I found insipring from this is when the user goes closer to the car the skeleton of the car through the app also get larger and you can inspect it in more detail. This might have been a simplier task to do compared to creating the visuals in the app but because of my interest in cars since I was little; it has inspired me to one day make an app related to cars in one way or another.
